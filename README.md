# Library-Management-System
Built a Python-based professional library management system that streamlines basic and advanced tasks in a library setting; the system passed tests on 500+ library logs

Developed multiple features and functions for the system, including:
 - Checks the studentâ€™s eligibility to borrow a book on a particular day for a certain number of days
 - Finds the most borrowed/popular books in the library
 - Finds the book that has the highest borrow ratio
 - Produces a sorted list of the most borrowed books/books with the highest usage ratio
 - Calculates the pending fines at the end of the log / at a specific day in the log
