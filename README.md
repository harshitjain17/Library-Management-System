# Library-Management-System
Used Python to build a full-fledged professional library management system to simplify basic and advanced tasks in the library and was successfully able to manage to test it on 420+ library logs
5 problems I solved using this project are listed below: 
1. Checking the studentâ€™s eligibility to borrow a book on a particular day for a certain number of days 
2. Finding the most borrowed/popular books in the library 
3. Finding the book that has the highest borrow ratio 
4. Producing a sorted list of most borrowed books / books with the highest usage ratio 
5. Calculating the pending fines at the end of the log / at a specific day in the log
